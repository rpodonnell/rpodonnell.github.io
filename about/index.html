	<h1>G'day, I'm Ryan.</h1>

	<p>I'm a fungal and plant evolutionary biology PhD candidate with the  
<a href="https://biology.anu.edu.au/research/groups/linde-group-population-genetics-evolution-phylogeography-and-molecular-phylogenetics">Linde Group</a> at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra. My current research is focused on investigating the evolution of the Australian orchid flora and its associated funga. I am also investigating species level questions in <em>Rhizoctonia</em> (Ceratobasidiaceae) and </em>Pterostylis</em> (Orchidaceae).

<p>More broadly, I have interests in systematics, taxonomy, species delimitation, and evolutionary ecology—particularly with respect to the evolution of symbiosis. Prior to starting my PhD, I completed my Master of Scientific Studies (Biodiversity Science) as a Vice-Chancellor's Scholar at the University of New England (UNE), where I was awarded the N.C.W. Beadle Scholarship in Botany to complete my Masters research project on the taxonomy, systematics and conservation of <em>Prostanthera</em> (Lamiaceae).</p>

	<p>Prior to becoming a scientist, I worked as an opera singer, voice actor, film maker, and writer. I have performed and had my films screened nationally and internationally, and I have won multiple prizes and scholarships for my work.</p>

<p>Rather than shy away from my unconventional career trajectory, I've decided to embrace it and acknowledge the diversity of experiences and skills that I have. 
	With my background in stage, media, and communications, I have been able to translate these skills to communicate complex ideas with non-specialist 
	audiences in an engaging way. I am a keen science communicator and educator, and I am passionate about storytelling with science. </p>
