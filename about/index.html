	<p>Hi! I'm Ryan and I'm a plant and fungal systematics/taxonomy PhD student with the  
<a href="https://biology.anu.edu.au/research/groups/linde-group-population-genetics-evolution-phylogeography-and-molecular-phylogenetics">Linde Group</a> at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra. My PhD project aims to investigate the systematics and taxonomy of <em>Pterostylis</em> sect. Foliosae (Orchidaceae) and their mycorrhizal symbionts (<em>Ceratobasidium</em>, Ceratobasidiaceae).</p>

<p>More broadly, my research interests focus on using integrative taxonomic methods to resolve species boundaries in taxonomically challenging groups. I recently completed a Master of Scientific Studies (Biodiversity Science) as a Vice-Chancellor's Scholar at the University of New England (UNE), where I was also awarded the N.C.W. Beadle Scholarship in Botany to complete my Masters research project on the taxonomy, systematics and conservation of <em>Prostanthera</em> (Lamiaceae).</p>

<p>Prior to becoming a systematist, I worked as an opera singer, voice actor, film maker, and writer. I have performed and had my films screened nationally and internationally, and I have won multiple prizes and scholarships for my work.</p>

<p>Rather than shy away from my unconventional career trajectory, I've decided to embrace it and acknowledge the diversity of experiences and skills that I have. I've had a rich and varied career so far and I'm grateful for the ways that these experiences have shaped my current work.</p>

<p>I still occasionally work as a voice actor and singer, and you can learn more about that <a href="rpodonnell.com.au"> here</a>.</p>
