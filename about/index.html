	<p>Hi! My name is Ryan and I'm a botanist based in Sydney, Australia. After a decade of experience working in the Creative and Performing Arts sectors, I've made the shift to the Sciences. I am in the process of completing a Master of Scientific Studies (Biodiversity Science) at the University of New England. My research interests lie in plant taxonomy and systematics, with a focus on using integrative taxonomic methods to resolve species boundaries in taxonomically challenging groups. Most recently, I was awarded the N.C.W. Beadle Scholarship in Botany to complete my Masters research project on the taxonomy, systematics and conservation of <em>Prostanthera</em> (Lamiaceae).</p>
