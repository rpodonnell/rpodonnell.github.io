	<h1>G'day, I'm Ryan.</h1>

	<p>I'm a plant and fungal systematics/taxonomy PhD student with the  
<a href="https://biology.anu.edu.au/research/groups/linde-group-population-genetics-evolution-phylogeography-and-molecular-phylogenetics">Linde Group</a> at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra. 
My PhD research is focused on applying phylogenomic methods to investigate the evolutionary relationships of the Diurideae (Orchidaceae) and their mycorrhizal symbionts. I am also investigating species level questions in </em>Pterostylis</em>(Orchidaceae)—predominantly the '<em>Bunochilus</em>' group i.e. <em>P.</em> sect. <em>Squamatae</em>—and <em>Ceratobasidium</em> (Ceratobasidiaceae).
<p>More broadly, my research interests focus on using integrative taxonomic methods to resolve species boundaries in taxonomically challenging groups. I recently completed a Master of Scientific Studies (Biodiversity Science) as a Vice-Chancellor's Scholar at the University of New England (UNE), where I was also awarded the N.C.W. Beadle Scholarship in Botany to complete my Masters research project on the taxonomy, systematics and conservation of <em>Prostanthera</em> (Lamiaceae).</p>

<p>Prior to becoming a systematist, I worked as an opera singer, voice actor, film maker, and writer. I have performed and had my films screened nationally and internationally, and I have won multiple prizes and scholarships for my work.</p>

<p>Rather than shy away from my unconventional career trajectory, I've decided to embrace it and acknowledge the diversity of experiences and skills that I have. 
	With my background in media, stage, and communications, I have been able to translate these skills to communicate complex ideas with non-specialist 
	audiences in an engaging way. I am a keen science communicator and educator, and I am passionate about storytelling with science. </p>

<p>I still occasionally work as a voice actor and singer, and you can learn more about that <a href="https://rpodonnell.com.au/"> here</a>.</p>
