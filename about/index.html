	<p>Hi! My name is Ryan and I'm a botanist based in Sydney, Australia. After a decade of experience working in the Creative and Performing Arts sectors, I've made the shift to the Sciences. I am in the final year of a Master of Scientific Studies (Biodiversity Science) at the University of New England. My research interests lie in plant taxonomy and systematics, with a focus on using integrative taxonomic methods to resolve species boundaries in taxonomically challenging groups. Most recently, I was awarded the N.C.W. Beadle Scholarship in Botany to complete my Masters research project on the taxonomy, systematics and conservation of <em>Prostanthera</em> (Lamiaceae).</p>
	<p>Prior to becoming a botanist, I worked as an opera singer, voice actor, film maker, and writer. I have performed and had my films screened nationally and internationally, and I have won multiple prizes and scholarships for my work.</p>
<p>Rather than shy away from my unconventional career trajectory, I've decided to embrace it and acknowledge the diversity of experiences and skills that I have. I've had a rich and varied career so far and I'm grateful for the ways that these experiences have shaped my current work.</p>
<p>I still occasionally work as a voice actor and singer, and you can learn more about that <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rpodonnell/ryan-odonnell-voice-reel-2020">here</a>.</p>
