I finally decided to set up a website for my scientific work! I'm going to try and use it as a repository for whatever code I've written so I can easily find it, and hopefully show some of the kinds of projects I've been working on. 

I think that scientists are multifaceted people, and we should acknowledge who we are outside of our scientific work. As such, I've made a point of embracing my unconventional career trajectories so far and my bio/cv pages acknowledge the diversity of experiences that I've had.
